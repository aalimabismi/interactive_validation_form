# Interactive Form Validation

**Responsive, modern, and user-friendly form validation for web projects**

---

## 🔥 Project Overview

`Interactive Form Validation` is a lightweight, accessible, and easy-to-integrate front-end module that demonstrates modern client-side form validation using HTML, CSS (Tailwind optional), and JavaScript. It provides real-time feedback, clear error messages, and smooth UI interactions — ideal for sign-ups, registration forms, contact forms, and admin panels.


---

## ✨ Key Features

* Real-time validation (on input / on blur)
* Custom validation rules for common fields (email, password, phone, username)
* Password strength meter and show/hide toggle
* Inline error messages and helper text
* Accessible (aria attributes, focus styles) and keyboard-friendly
* Configurable validation rules (easy to extend)
* Works with plain HTML/JS or integrated with frameworks

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS** (Tailwind CSS recommended — optional)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+)

---

## 🚀 Demo

**Live demo:** `https://student-faculty-form.netlify.app/` 

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/aalimabismi/interactive_validation_form.git)
cd interactive-form-validation
```

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a simple static server:

```bash
# using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

---

## 📝 Usage

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Try submitting empty fields — validation prevents submit and shows helpful messages.
3. Customize validation rules in `script.js`.

---

## 🔧 Validation Rules (examples)

* **Username:** required, 3–20 characters, letters/numbers/underscore
* **Email:** required, valid email format
* **Password:** required, min 8 chars, includes uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
* **Confirm Password:** must match password
* **Phone:** optional/required depending on form, numeric, 10 digits

You can change these rules inside `script.js` or extract them into a separate config object for reuse.

## ✅ Accessibility & UX

* Uses semantic HTML (`<label>`, `<input>`, `<button>`) for screen readers
* `aria-live` regions for announcing validation messages
* Keyboard focus styles for clear navigation
